---

## **Overview**

This repository contains Python code to generate realistic simulated plots for a **DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) + Leverage Algorithm**. The algorithm is designed to:

- Optimize average entry price during market drawdowns.
- Scale investment amounts dynamically using increasing leverage.
- Reduce liquidation risk while maximizing potential returns.

The figures generated by this code were used in the research paper to illustrate the algorithmâ€™s performance under different leverage strategies (increasing, decreasing, uniform).

## **Algorithm Description**

1. **DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging):**
   - Positions are taken at evenly spaced price drawdowns.
   - Formula for DCA levels:

   \[
   D_k = f + k \frac{((n+1)\cdot 2 - f)}{n}, \quad k = 0,1,2,\dots,n
   \]

   Where:  
   - \(f\) = initial DCA percentage  
   - \(n\) = number of DCA steps  
   - \(k\) = current DCA step  

2. **Leverage Allocation:**
   - Leverage can be applied in **increasing**, **decreasing**, or **uniform** sequences.  
   - Example: Increasing leverage = [2, 4, 6, 7, 10]  
   - Larger leverage is applied to cheaper DCA entries to improve average entry price and reduce liquidation risk.

3. **Investment Scaling:**
   - Effective investment at each step:  
     \[
     \text{Effective Investment}_i = A \cdot L_i
     \]  
   - Ensures larger positions are taken at lower prices.
